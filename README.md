## Introduction 
**Background**

The "Furuta Pendulum" is a sytem of two arms linked together controlled by one motor. The first arm rotates in a horizontal plane and the second arm rotates in a vertical plane at the end of the first arm. A motor is attached to one end of the first arm while the second arm is attached to the other end. The second arm rotates freely about its rotation plane. A Furuta Pendulm can be seen in the figure below.

The goal is to balance the second arm in an upwards vertical position. To acheive this, control methods must be developed, tested and implemented. A mathematical model is devloped in MATLAB using the methods developed by Hernández-Guzmán (870). The model is simulated in CoppeliaSim to verify its success.
